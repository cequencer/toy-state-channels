# Toy State Channels

**WARNING: This code is a TOY implementation designed for educational and explanatory purposes only and is NOT SAFE for production use.**  Numerous key safety features have been left purposely unimplemented for the sake of readability and brevity.

The Toy State Channels project is a work-in-progress aiming to provide a clear, readable example of a fully abstracted [state channel](http://www.jeffcoleman.ca/state-channels/) framework, where a single blockchain-based commitment of assets or permissions can be used for an unlimited number of payments, smart contracts, etc. without further operations needing to be performed on the blockchain itself.   This project uses Solidity contracts on the Ethereum blockchain and implements clientside functionality in HTML5/Javascript.  It takes advantage of previous work done at [Ledger Labs](http://ledgerlabs.com/) by Jeff Coleman, Denton Liu, and Anna Wang, with assistance from many others.  Code for this project is MIT licensed, and documentation is CC-BY-SA 4.0
