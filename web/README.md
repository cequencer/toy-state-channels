# ⚠️ Warning! ⚠️

The client interface code is nowhere near completion. The interface is ugly and very little logic code has been created!
For your own safety, please refrain from looking at this code for prolonged periods of time as this may pose a potential
health hazard.

The final goal for this directory is to create an interface for a payment channel similar to the [previous iteration of
the state channel project](https://github.com/AnnaIsAWang/LedgerLabsCoops2016/tree/master/AbstractedStateChannel/web).
